#Exercise Background
A friend of yours has decided to get into the travel business and has just started up a low price airline-company called BrianAir. He is now designing the java-script based booking web page and has realized that he needs a database in the back-end. He knows you are taking a database-course and has hence asked you to design and implement the flight and booking database. In other words you are supposed to plan and set up the database he will use for his company. You think the company is a terrible idea but as a good friend you have agreed to help him.
The main idea of the website is that a customer should be able to enter it, search for flights and create bookings on these flights. The booking procedure should be fairly simple where the customer creates a reservation for a number of people on a flight and get a reservation-number. The customer should then be able to add passengers to the reservation as well as some contact details. Finally the customer should be able to add payment details and pay for the reservation and thereby ensure that the passengers have seats on the chosen plane. When this happens the reservation is said to become a booking. All of this can be done within one session at the web page, but the customer should also be able to create a reservation, check the price, and finish the booking procedure at a later date using the given reservation number.
